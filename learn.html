            <p>In 1997, I earned a scholorship to Devry University for a college class on C++.
                After that class, I also messed around with my Texas Instruments TI-89 calculator to create a basic blackjack game.   As a result of that initial class and my programming, as well as my high GPA in high school, I earned a scholorship to Devry University covering 25% of my tuition.   Unfortunately, going full time to school still cost upwards of $800/month which became unaffordable to me after just 3 semesters.   I dropped out, and paid off the remainder of my student loans.   I did not resume school until 2014 when I realized my work would pay for up to 4 classes a year if I went to Strayer University.    At that point, I went back and started on my Associate's in Arts Information Technology.   I am proud to say that I graduated summa cum laude with a GPA of 3.94.  Since then, I have been messing around with coding a little on my own, but eventually I will return to finish my bachelor's degree.
