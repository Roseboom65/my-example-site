            <h3>Learn some of what makes me tick.</h3>
        <p>Hi.   On this page I will tell you a little more about myself. </p>
    
        </div>

    <div class="features"></div>

    <p class="me">  I learned to overcome adversity at a very young age, as I needed to have open-heart surgery at the age of 4 to repair a hole in my heart and a leaky valve.   
        Additionally, when I was 18, I had a stroke that completely paralyzed the left side of my body.  As scary as that sounds, it saved my life as the doctors at the hospital discovered a second hole in my heart that would have killed me by 23 if it was left unrepaired.    Thus, I had my second open-heart surgery at the age of 18.   </p> 

        <p class="me"></p>While recovering from my stroke and surgery, I met and began to date my future husband Steve.   We got married in Las Vegas in October 2001.    </p> 

        <p class="me">We were living in Arizona, but in 2003, we decided that the climate here was more agreeable in Utah, so made the move here to Salt Lake City.  </p> 
        
        <p class="me">In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing video games, as well as watching TV and movies.   </p> 

        <p class="me">I also own a 2020 Polaris Rzr as well as a camper with a deck (so we can take the Rzr with us), and several times in the summer, we enjoy going to the mountains to go camping and ATV riding.   </p>
